## Introduction

BozBoc ("we," "our," or "us") operates the BlueMouse mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our App.

## Information We Collect

### Information We DO NOT Collect

BlueMouse is designed with your privacy in mind. We want to be clear: **we do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or user data.**

Specifically, we do not collect:
- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- Device information (device ID, IMEI, etc.)
- Location data
- Usage analytics or statistics
- Crash reports or diagnostic data
- Bluetooth connection history
- Any data about your PC or connected devices
- Any input data (mouse movements, keyboard input, etc.)

### Information Stored Locally

The App stores minimal data locally on your device for functionality purposes only:
- **Last Connected Device Address**: Stored locally to enable quick reconnection
- **Last Connected Device Name**: Stored locally for display purposes
- **Trackpad Sensitivity Setting**: Stored locally for your preference

This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not transmitted to any server
- Is not shared with any third party
- Can be deleted by uninstalling the App

## How We Use Information

The locally stored preferences (device address and sensitivity) are used only to:
- Remember your last connected device
- Sort your device list for convenience
- Maintain your sensitivity preference

- Connect to your PC via Bluetooth HID protocol
- Send input commands (mouse and keyboard) to your PC

**Important:** All Bluetooth communication happens directly between your phone and PC. No data passes through our servers or any third-party services.

The Bluetooth connection between your phone and PC uses:
- Standard Bluetooth pairing security

- No custom authentication that could create vulnerabilities
